# Coursera-DL-Recurrent-NN
This repository contains my Coursera Deep Learning Recurrent Neural Network workbooks. RNNs are most commonly used for time series data and natural language applications. 
Code is documented in the Jupiter Notebooks, here provided in HTML format.
* Building_a_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step_v3contains code building a RNN from scratch. 
* Dinosaurus_Island_Character_level_language_model_final_v3 contains a RNN Dinosaur name synthesizer.
* Operations_on_word_vectors_v2 contains code analyzing and debiasing word encodings.
* Emojify_v2.html contains both a basic and LSTM sentiment analisis model that attaches appropriate emoji to texts. 
* Neural_machine_translation_with_attention_v4 contains implementation of a machine learning algorithm that translates dates into machine readable formats.
* Trigger_word_detection_v1 contains step by step implemented trigger word detection.
* Improvise_a_Jazz_Solo_with_an_LSTM_Network_v3 contains an LSTM implementation of a music generator.
